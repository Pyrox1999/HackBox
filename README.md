# HackBox
I came up with the idea for this tool while taking a shower, just casually. However, this method already exists: Timing Attack!
I have never used this tool for hacking, only on my own localhost. For proper hacking, you need a very stable internet connection. And: Many good sites are already protected against timing attacks nowadays and add an artificial delay after each query. So: Create your own site and test it with that! I am not liable for anything!
You might need to change the username field. Sometimes "email" or "emailInput" or something similar is used. To do this, you need to change the variable in my python script.
